<div class="yoga-content"> 
  <p>I've been practicing yoga since my first class at the university gym in 2010 and now I'm enrolled in my first 200 hour yoga teacher training this summer. with so many ways to flow, I'm particularly interested in figuring out what styles, poses, and paths work for different bodies.</p>

  <p>I'm unabashedly obsessed with the learning process as well so ping me if you'd like to chat about one of my teacher projects. or if, maybe, you want someone to teach a yoga class at your office. double or if, just maybe, you'd like to take a class at some of the coolest studios in the triangle.</p>

  <p>I can't wait to speak with you!</p>
